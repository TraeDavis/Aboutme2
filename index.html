    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
        <p class="first">Hello, my name is <b>Trae Davis</b>. I was a firefighter in the <b>USMC</b> for 4 years. After getting out of the Marines I went to school for IT and after getting a job in the field realized it was not something that I could see my myself doing as a career. I did alot of research on other tech related fields and really liked the sound of being a web developer. Now I am enrolled in this course and excited to learn and work hard to make a solid career in web development. </p>
